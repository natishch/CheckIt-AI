# Raw Data Directory

This directory contains raw, unprocessed data files for the project.

## Project Planning Files

### Implementation Tasks
- **impl-tasks-with-priority-and-dependencies.json** - Structured task definitions with priorities and dependencies
- **impl-tasks-with-prompts.json** - Implementation prompts and guidance for each task

These files are used for project planning and can be consumed by automation scripts (e.g., `sync_tasks.py`).

## Future Data Files

This directory will also store:
- Raw TruthfulQA datasets (before preprocessing)
- Raw search results cache
- Other unprocessed input data
